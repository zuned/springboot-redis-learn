** These are my experiences while working with elasticache.

** TLS enable - is add over head 
** We should use connection pool - to connect with Redis
** tunnelling only used for the purpose of debug and monitoring
** When TLS enable we should connect directly to maskter node.
** Redis is very fast but still it add's n/w overhead. If number of request increases then perfomance can decrease. To overcome at time client side caching can be done lazily.
